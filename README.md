# My Levenshtein

• Wrote an algorithm that calculates the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two words

• Function took in 2 strings with the exact number of characters and returns an integer representing the difference between them.

• If parameters are not the same size then the function will return -1

• If the two strings are the same size, algorithm iterates through each string and determines which characters are different

• Each time there is a difference, it counts as 1
